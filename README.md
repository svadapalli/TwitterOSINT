Open source intelligence (OSINT) is a method of using open source tools to collect information from publicly available sources and then analyze it in order to make a decision or take some action.  This Project implements a prototype system named TwitterOSINT which is designed to collect and analyze cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities information posted on Twitter and serve as an OSINT source. Intelligence about a threat is of temporal nature, which a security analyst must keep up with in order to take preventive/corrective measures before his/her organization is affected. TwitterOSINT serves this purpose of providing timely intelligence for the analysts to proactively act upon. Tweets are analyzed in real time to extract information about various threats, by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. To store, search and visualize the gathered intelligence we use the Elastic Stack which is comprised of Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana.
